 The app is very basic and just instantiate a bot and lets it communicate with the server instantly.
 Check README on how to start a bot against the server.

 You start the bot directly from the root folder with "node build/client/app.js ws://127.0.0.1:3000". So it connects by default to a server running on localhost on port 3000.
